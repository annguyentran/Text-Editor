# Text-Editor

The text editor uses the webpack so that the user can install into their brower so that they can use the text editor offline. They can download it by clicking a download icon on the right side of their search bar. Though as of now, google chrome is one of the few browers that can do this. The user can write what they want and it is saved in a database that they can see in their inspector tools. The user is able to delete the saved data if they wish to do so and start again.
